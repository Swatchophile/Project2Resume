FE-Nanodegree
Udacity Front End Nanodegree - Project 2 - Interactive resume
==============================================================

Apart from required objects, added a navigation object to resumeBuilder.js, and another function to display and hide menu items on mouseover and mouseout.

Added a simple d3js chart next to the skill list, and a jQuery function to make the skill section slightly more interactive (can be found towards the end of the body section in the index.html file)

Made a few very minor changes to helper.js to delete/edit/add some tags, and rename some others

Added minified version of d3.js
